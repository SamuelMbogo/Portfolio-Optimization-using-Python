## Business Understanding
An investor in the stock market is after two things, which unfortunately, are mutually exclusive. High returns and low risk. Most stocks that yield high returns have an equally high volatility that scares away potential investors. Investment managers offer their services and encourage their clients to trust their judgement skills derived from industry experience.

In numerous cases, this works. However, what if a tool is developed that can aid investment managers and investors who are hands-on to manage their risk using already available historical stock prices to guide their decision making.

When working on this, I had just the thought in mind. Removing the tedious and repetitive tasks that overwhelm a trader and sometimes pushes him to guess. Using python to automate retrieving stock prices and leveraging on sharpe's ratio,  I built a simple analysis tool that can help any trader or investment manager to determine which stock is worth investing and how much to invest in each stock given a fixed amount of capital to start with.

Investors in the stock market are in need of a means to optimize their portfolios to maximize their returns while at the same time, taking on as little risk as possible.

## Recommendations

## Limitations
In this projCreated a portfolio optimization notebook that analyzed 4 US stocks: Apple, AMD, Microsoft and Amazon.

The analysis covered the period from 01/01/2019 to 17/10/2022.
Data was imported from Yahoo finance. 
The idea was inspired by CFI's BIDA course on python fundamentals. 
I tweaked the code to cover a larger time period, better graphs and did an in-depth analysis coupled with a recommendation at the end.

As of 18/10/2022, the optimal Sharpe Ratio is 1.18975 and Optimal Portfolio Allocation is:

| Stock  | Allocation |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Apple  | 88.952%  |
| Advanced Micro Devices  | 5.024%  |
| Microsoft  | 4.857%  |
| Amazon  | 1.165%  |

 I would conclude to substitute IMB shares to something more profitable.
