# Portfolio-Optimization-using-Python
Created a portfolio optimization notebook that analyzed 4 US stocks: Apple, AMD, Microsoft and Amazon.

The analysis covered the period from 01/01/2019 to 17/10/2022.
Data was imported from Yahoo finance. 
The idea was inspired by CFI's BIDA course on python fundamentals. 
I tweaked the code to cover a larger time period, better graphs and did an in-depth analysis coupled with a recommendation at the end.

As of 18/10/2022, the optimal Sharpe Ratio is 1.18975 and Optimal Portfolio Allocation is:

| Stock  | Allocation |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Apple  | 88.952%  |
| Advanced Micro Devices  | 5.024%  |
| Microsoft  | 4.857%  |
| Amazon  | 1.165%  |

 I would conclude to substitute IMB shares to something more profitable.
